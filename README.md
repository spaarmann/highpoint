# Highpoint

## What is this?

In this repository I'll be working on creating fluid simulation in Unity.
This is mostly intended as a learning project and the scope is still very much in flux.
More information will follow once some code has actually been written.

The project is currently using Unity 2019.1.5f1.

## What's up with the name?

`Highpoint` is just a codename. I'm terrible at coming up with names so I drew on my usual naming convention for arbitrary names and chose a ship name from [Iain M. Banks' Culture series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture_(series)) of books.

## License
